# About The Project
![Electronjs App](https://github.com/ShivankK26/Desktop-Image-Resizing-App/assets/115289871/99a1c689-b40e-4537-a78d-f1d543348f61)






In this Project, I've built a Desktop App called Image Resizing App in which a user can easily resize an Image as per their convenience. The Best part of this Application is that it is to be used on a Desktop, i.e the user does not need to have an Active Internet Connection. It can be easily used in a Laptop, Tablet, Desktop, etc. So, just use it and have fun!


Use the `README.md` to get started.
